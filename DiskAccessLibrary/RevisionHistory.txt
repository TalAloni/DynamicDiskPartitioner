1.1.8 - Fixed NTFS related issues.

1.1.9 - Disks are now orderered according to disk number.
		Code clean up.

1.2.0 - NTFS related bugfixes.
		Write operations on readonly disks are no longer silently ignored and now raising exceptions, added missing readonly check to VMDK files.

1.2.1 - Minor enhancements and fixes.

1.2.2 - Minor NTFS changes.

1.2.3 - Fixed: LDM extent record now properly support the 0x40 flag.

      - Bugfix: VHD was not extended to the correct size.

1.2.9 - We now use the same caching policy for virtual disk read and write operations. (Workaround for hosts without KB981166).
	  - Bugfix: GPT header checksum verification failed if the size of the partition entries was not a multiple of sector size.
